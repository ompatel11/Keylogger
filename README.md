A keylogger which sends keystrokes to your email. This keylogger disguises itself from the victim's screen and runs in the background.
It records every keystroke of the victim's keyboard and sends it back to an email address for further exploitation. 
This keylogger can succesfully 
bipasse the Windows Defender.

For running this keylogger:-

Step 1: Copy the Keylogger.cpp file.

Step 2: Copy and compile the SendMail.cpp differently and put the exe in the same folder as the Keylogger.cpp.

Step 3: Now run the Keylogger.cpp file.

You can combine both the exe files as you like to disguise it from the victim.
